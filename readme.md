## Description
This is a PWA that allows for the user to track monthly expenses both online and offline. The user may also download the application to their desktop for ease of access. If a user posts a change to their budget tracker with no connection then indexDB is used to cache the post and save it to post when connection is restored.

The frontend and backend were provided by the University of Arizona. The added features of service-workers and indexDB was created by myself.
